A vector field is a representation of the vector direction, and sometimes with magnitude also, in specified point in the space giving a feeling of the physical problem in hand, we see vector field in many aspects in science and engineering for example we live in a gravitational field acting on every mass pulling it toward earth, fluid flow is another important example like the air flow around a plane wing this field show the velocity of fluid particles everywhere in space, there are also the electric field around charges and magnetic fields which forms when the charges are in motion, by analysis of the physical laws in the studied situation a differential equation appears, in this paper we show the method of visualizing such field using numerical solution to the governing differential equation on MATLAB software, the second part of the program detects the path or the potential level of a particular particle in the field the user set its initial position giving the ability of studying the interaction between the field and particles within.
The code is implemented in a GUI (user friendly) to facilitate using the program.
